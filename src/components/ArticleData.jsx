      'As the name suggests, Riverwalk is a narrow neighborhood stretch along the rippling waters of the Mississippi River. "The whole goal is to see Tom Lee Park and the Mississippi," says Mike Parker, a local realtor with The Firm. More so, Big River Crossing and the Hernando De Soto Bridge energize the horizons with light shows each night. "I say people like the bridge view at night almost as much as seeing the river," Parker adds. ',

      "Intimate concerts at the local bars, shareable pizza and the underestimated landscape of northeast Ohio are a few things that residents in Austintown, Ohio hold dear. Although people may not recognize how beautiful northeast Ohio's scenery is, it's riddled with clusters of stretching oak and maple trees waiting for the seasonal turn of leaves. Each season in Austintown is like a different painting, blurring with reds, browns and greens as it passes through a car window. Framed by nature, Austintown also features dozens of locally owned restaurants and shops for residents to enjoy.",

      "Moss clings to the historic Samuel L. Davis cigar factory, reminding onlookers of North Hyde Park's century-old industrial roots. Initially a booming business center, North Hyde Park has since relaxed into quiet suburbia.\n\nResidents can find a variety of house styles and sizes in the area. Craftsman bungalows feature stone accents, sturdy pillars and covered porches. Shotgun style cottages offer more modest styles, often adorned with iron-wrought porch railings. Bright paint colors or brick exteriors help personalize simplistic single stories. Traditional two-story builds often feature a stucco exterior and low-pitched roofs.",
